       GIT & GITHUB 
● Git is a version control system or tool. Simply, a system to manage your files. ● Saves the file locally or remote server(github/gitlab) 
● Made by the linux development community
● GitHub is a Web site/server which your git is hosted on. 
● Your files will be saved in folder called “REPOSITORY”

    Git commands 
# For FIRST TIME 
● cd Desktop 
● mkdir gtst && cd gtst 
● git init 
● git config –-global user.name

● git clone
   -step 1 : make a file , (name).md and  save it
   -step 2 : check the status
   -step 3 : commit it
   -step 4 : create repository on github
   -step 5 : add the repository link
   -step 6 : generate token
   -step 7 : copy your token link and save it where you find it
   -step 8 : push it on github

    visual studio code
-step 1 : find account sign below
-step 2 : turn on setting sync
-step 3 : sign in with github
-step 4 : authorize vs code
-step 5 : it will ask to install an extension
-step 6 : it will log 
-step 7 : find a branch sign😁 source controll then description and commit

     for hurrying(chekola😂)
-step 1 : go on browser and search github
-step 2 : find anote saying (uploading an existing file)
-step 3 : drag and drop them in your repository

    Github Desktop

    Introduction to Ethical Hacking What is hacking? 
➔ Hacking is referred to exploiting system vulnerabilities and compromising security controls to gain unauthorized access to the system.
➔ Ethical hacking finds the weak points or loopholes in a computer, web application, or network and reports them to the organization
➔ The person who do the hacking is called “HACKER”.

    Types of hackers based on Ethics 
BLACK HAT hackers ➔ are people who gain unauthorized access and use it for bad things and my be destroy the entire system👎👎👎
White HAT hackers ➔ The helping and Good Peoples that help people with patching their systems vulnerublities😊😊😊
Grey HAT hackers ➔ The middle mans, some times good 😊😊 some times bad👎 thinking People

     Types of hackers based on Skill
Newbie / Noob - Don’t have any knowledge about hacking.👶👶
Script Kiddie - A script kiddie, skiddie, kiddie, or skid is a relatively unskilled individual who uses scripts or programs developed by others, primarily for malicious purposes😜
Hacker ● Perfectly skilled, with less experience👨‍💻👨‍💻
Elite/Pro Hacker ● Perfectly skilled, with Much more experience😎😎🤯🤯

    Why do we learn hacking?
1. To prevent hackers from gaining access 
2. To uncover vulnerabilities 
3. To strengthen the organization
4. To safeguard the data 
5. To avoid security Breaches
6. To enhance security awareness
7. To make money

       Why hack happens? 
★ ATTACKS = MOTIVE(GOAL) + METHOD + VULNERABILITY 
★ MOTIVE:- Information theft, manipulating data, Financial loss,Revenge, Ransom, Damaging Reputation.

    Elements of Information security
★ CIA triad
C=confidentiality
  -the information is safe from accidental or intentional disclosure
I=integrity
  -the information is safe from accidental or intentional modification or alteration
A=avilablity
 -the information is avilable to authorized users when needed
 
     Skills we need to be hacker 
 ★ Programming 
 ★ Networking 
 ★ Linux
 ★ System admin
 
     Phases of Hacking 
  1. Reconnaissance
  2. Scanning 
  3. Gaining Access
  4. Maintaining Access 
  5. Clearing Tracks or Logs
  
    Penetration Testing 
  ★ Penetration Testing is a method of evaluating the security of an information system or network by simulating an attack to 
★ find vulnerability
★ Security Measures
★ Documentation and Report Preparation

    Why we need Penetration Testing?
★ Identification of threats 
★ Security Protections and controls
★ Assessment of Organization's Security
★ Evaluation of Network Security 
★ Upgradation of Infrastructure

     Types of Pentesting
Black Box Pentesting 
● Testing system without prior knowledge. 
● You test as an attacker
White Box Pentesting 
● Testing system with prior knowledge.
● You test as an Developer
Grey Box Pentesting 
● Testing system with Limited knowledge. 
● You test as an User.
